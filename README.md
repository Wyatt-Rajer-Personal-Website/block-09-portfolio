# Block 09 Portfolio

## About this portfolio
I struggle with coming up with fake content for these types of project. I went with Gandalf. The OG trilogy movies are goated. Really not a huge fan of the hobbit movies and I'd go so far as to say I dislike them.

For this project I included:
- a Home/Index page
- a Portfolio page
- an About page
- a CSS file
- This insightful README

All of it stylized as if I was a literal wizard. Enjoy!
